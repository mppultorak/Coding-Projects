# Implementing formula for given n
n = int(input("Enter a number: ")) # Take input
k = (n*(n+1))/2 # Finds summation 

print(f'The result for {n} summations is: {k}') # Prints result

### The result of B and C are the same
### The difference between the two is one used a for loop and the other used a formula
### Futhermore, part c results in a floating point rather than an int
