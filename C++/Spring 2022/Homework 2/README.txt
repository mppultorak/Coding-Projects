Structure of program:
---------------------
File organization: mainsource.cpp, Rectangle.cpp, CompareArea.h, ComparePerimeter.h
Functional organization: mainsource builds a 10 Rectangle objects and places them into a vector.
A template functions "findmax()" will find the max perimeter and area based upon the class passed: CompareArea or ComparePerimeter.
The results will then be printed.

Status: It works completely.

Hardware & Platform I used: M1-Pro chip, 16 gb of ram, and mac os.

Compile: extract the archive and from a shell and run "make" This will create an executable "runexe" Then run ./runexe
