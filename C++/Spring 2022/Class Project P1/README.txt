Structure of program:
---------------------
File organization: main.cpp, Grade.cpp, Grade.h, database.cpp, R1.cpp, R6.cpp, R7.cpp
Functional organization: main calls menu() from database.cpp which builds creates a menu that prompts user to write, read, and display from a .csv file. 
The data in .csv file is read and formatted as grade objects and places them into a vector. 

Status: It works completely.

Hardware & Platform I used: M1-Pro chip, 16 gb of ram, and mac os.

Compile: extract the archive and from a shell and run "make" This will create an executable "runexe" Then run ./runexe
