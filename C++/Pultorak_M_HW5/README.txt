Structure of program:
---------------------
File organization: mainsource.cpp, node.cpp, maze.cpp
Functional organization: main() builds a maze made up of of pointer class: node
The program allows for the user to travel between nodes and ends once the end is reached (node "L").

Status: It works completely.

Hardware & Platform I used: M1-Pro chip, 16 gb of ram, and mac os.

Compile: extract the archive and from a shell run "make" This will create an executable "runexe" Then run ./runexe
