Structure of program:
---------------------
File organization: PultorakHW2.cpp
Functional organization: main() takes input of string, then returns if it is palindromic. If not, it makes it palindromic.

Status: It works completely.

Hardware & Platform I used: Intel core i7-8550U with 16GB of RAM (Windows 10 operating system)

Compile: extract the archive and from a shell run "make" This will create an exicutable "pultorakhw2" Then run ./pultorakhw2
