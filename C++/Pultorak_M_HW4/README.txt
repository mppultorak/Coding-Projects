Structure of program:
---------------------
File organization: mainsource.cpp, Grid.cpp, WaterVehicle.cpp, Submarine.cpp
Functional organization: main() takes input of (x, y, ship length, orienation, and dive depth).
It then outputs the ship onto a 10x10 grid and shoots random torpedos. It will then test if the ship was hit. 
Finally, it will create a new obj and set it equal to the old. The details of the ship will then be printed.

Status: It works completely.

Hardware & Platform I used: M1-Pro chip, 16 gb of ram, and mac os.

Compile: extract the archive and from a shell run "make" This will create an executable "runexe" Then run ./runexe
